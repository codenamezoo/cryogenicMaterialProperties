Codes for physical properties of cryogenic material 

Here, I will upload some codes to calculate selected properties of popular cryogenic materials from open-to-public sources (such as https://trc.nist.gov/cryogenics/materials/materialproperties.htm).

Main base flatform will be JS and Matlab. 

If you have any questions, or new sources to share, please let me know.
